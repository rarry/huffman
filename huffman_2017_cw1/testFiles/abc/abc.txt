Feature extraction transforms the data in the high-dimensional space to a space of fewer dimensions. The data transformation may be linear, as in principal component analysis (PCA), but many nonlinear dimensionality reduction techniques also exist.[3][4] For multidimensional data, tensor representation can be used in dimensionality reduction through multilinear subspace learning.[5]
